We usually spend a lot of time reading and surfing others open source project on GitHub. It turned out, this process can be much better. Here is a short list of most useful extensions you might be interested in.

## OctoLinker

> Navigate through projects on GitHub.com efficiently

Basically jump to npm package or filename through `import/require` statements.

- Website [https://octolinker.github.io/](https://octolinker.github.io/)
- _Available for Chrome, Firefox and Opera_

## hide files

> Hide dotfiles from the file browser

In my personal project i do have 7 dotfiles on one actual `index.js`. And those files are usually the same, so its not very useful to see them every time.

- Repository [https://github.com/sindresorhus/hide-files-on-github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hide-files-on-github)
- _Available for Chrome and Opera_

## refined github

> Chrome extension that simplifies the GitHub interface and adds useful features

It's like [reddit enhancement suite][res], but for github. Check it out.

- Repository [https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github)
- _Available for Chrome and Safari_

[res]: https://redditenhancementsuite.com/

## npmhub

Usually, when you need to investigate project's dependecies, you have to look through `package.json` and [octolinker](#octolinker) can probably help with that, but there is a better option. _npmhub_ allows you to see list of all dependencies and devDependencies used in the project. You will find that list below the README.
