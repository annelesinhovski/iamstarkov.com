# About

Hi üëè

My name is Vladimir Starkov and I am an experienced Frontend Engineer.

I know how to build JavaScript library (with a decent API surface) from scratch with top notch developer experience tailored for the team or a company, without forgetting best practices and processes around code quality.

I also know how to build a complex yet scalable web application from scratch using industry accepted tech stack: nodejs, react, redux, react-router, react-loadable and etc. Needless to say I can setup all the required tooling for it too (webpack, babel, etc). I know how all of this tech and CSS work under the hood.

Last but not least, I am no stranger to educating people: talks, mentorship, and courses. I've been there, done that.

Few projects of mine are [getbem.com][]‚Äîabout BEM, which was one of the best CSS methodologies at the time and [BlackBox][] which offered a safe and secure way to leak documents about government level corruption in Russian Federation

On the other note in my spare time I love to listen to music, hike and watch dystopian sci-fi movies and tv series.

Check my profiles on [Twitter][], [GitHub][], [npm][] and [LinkedIn][] or my [talks](/talks/). Write me a letter on [iamstarkov@gmail.com](mailto:iamstarkov@gmail.com).

### Colophon

_[iamstarkov.com](https://iamstarkov.com/)_ is built with [Next.js][], have been [open sourced][src] and hosted on [Now][] by [Zeit][].

It is an experiment on blog format and modern web, tools,
typography and minimalism. I started with [minimum viable blog](https://iamstarkov.com/mvb/) and since then gradually
transforming it in my ideal blog.
